            question: "What is a Greedy Algorithm?",
            answer: "A Greedy Algorithm makes the best choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum."
        },
        {
            question: "Why is a proof needed for greedy algorithms?",
            answer: "Greedy algorithms do not guarantee correctness, so a proof is required to ensure the solution is optimal."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the key components of a greedy algorithm?",
            answer: "1. Candidate set (C): All possible choices.\n2. Solution set (S): Current choices that form the solution.\n3. Feasibility function: Determines if adding a candidate keeps the solution valid.\n4. Selection function: Picks the best candidate."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the general structure of a greedy algorithm?",
            answer: "1. Start with an empty solution.\n2. Iteratively add the best candidate to the solution while it remains feasible.\n3. Stop when the solution is complete."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the strategy for solving the meeting room scheduling problem?",
            answer: "Choose meetings that end the earliest to maximize the number of non-overlapping meetings."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the time complexity of the meeting room scheduling problem using the greedy approach?",
            answer: "O(n log n) due to the need to sort meetings by their end times."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the Egyptian Fraction problem?",
            answer: "Represent a fraction \( p/q \) as a sum of distinct unit fractions (fractions with numerator 1)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the key idea in the greedy solution for the Egyptian Fraction problem?",
            answer: "Find the largest unit fraction less than or equal to \( p/q \), subtract it, and repeat until the remainder is zero."
        },
        {
            question: "What is an example of the Egyptian Fraction problem solution?",
            answer: "For \( 5/6 \):\n1. Find \( 1/2 \), subtract to get \( 1/3 \).\n2. Subtract \( 1/3 \) to get 0. Final solution: \( 5/6 = 1/2 + 1/3 \)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the key difference between the two approaches to solving the Egyptian Fraction problem?",
            answer: "The first approach iterates incrementally to find the unit fraction, while the second approach uses the ceiling function to directly find the next unit fraction."
