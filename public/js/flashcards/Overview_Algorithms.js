            question: "What is the formal definition of an algorithm?",
            answer: "A finite sequence of well-defined instructions that produces the correct output for any valid input within a finite amount of time."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the three key properties of an algorithm?",
            answer: "1. Correctness: Produces the required output for every input.\n2. Finiteness: Terminates after a finite number of steps.\n3. Uniqueness: Every step is precisely defined."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference between 'program' and 'algorithm'?",
            answer: "A program is an implementation of an algorithm, often written in a specific programming language and intended for execution on a computer."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the 'Halting Problem' in algorithms?",
            answer: "The Halting Problem is the question of determining whether an algorithm will terminate for all inputs. It is proven to be unsolvable in general."
        },
        {
            question: "Why is recursion useful in algorithm design?",
            answer: "Recursion simplifies problems by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their results to solve the original problem."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the time complexity of the Towers of Hanoi problem for \( n \) disks?",
            answer: "The time complexity is \( T(n) = 2^n - 1 \), which is \( O(2^n) \)."
        },
        {
            question: "What does \( T(n) = T(n-1) + n \) represent in recurrence relations?",
            answer: "It represents an algorithm whose total complexity grows quadratically as \( \Theta(n^2) \)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the Master Theorem used for?",
            answer: "It provides a method to solve recurrence relations that commonly appear in divide-and-conquer algorithms."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the Stable Marriage Problem?",
            answer: "It is the problem of finding a stable matching between two sets of elements (e.g., men and women) such that no two individuals prefer each other over their current partners."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the time complexity of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the Stable Marriage Problem?",
            answer: "The Gale-Shapley algorithm has a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \), where \( n \) is the number of participants in each group."
