            question: "What is the principle of inclusion-exclusion in set theory?",

            question: "What is a Cartesian product of two sets A and B?",

        },
        {
            question: "How is a subset defined?",

            question: "What is the empty set and its significance?",
            answer: "The empty set contains no elements and is a subset of every set."

        {
            question: "What is the power set of a set A?",
            answer: "It is the set of all subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself."

            question: "What is the difference between a union and an intersection of sets?",
            answer: "Union combines all elements from both sets, while intersection includes only common elements."
