            question: "What is dynamic programming?",
            answer: "Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them into simpler overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant calculations."
        },
        {
            question: "How does dynamic programming differ from divide and conquer?",
            answer: "Dynamic programming solves overlapping subproblems and stores their results, while divide and conquer solves independent subproblems and combines their solutions."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the two key properties of problems suitable for dynamic programming?",
            answer: "1. Optimal Substructure: The solution to a problem can be composed of solutions to its subproblems.\n2. Overlapping Subproblems: Subproblems recur multiple times."
        },
        {
            question: "What is memoization?",
            answer: "Memoization is an optimization technique where computed solutions to subproblems are stored and reused instead of being recomputed."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the time complexity of the Fibonacci number computation using dynamic programming?",
            answer: "The time complexity is O(n) when using dynamic programming."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up approaches in dynamic programming?",
            answer: "Top-down involves recursion with memoization, while bottom-up solves problems iteratively by building solutions from smaller subproblems."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the recursive relation for the stair climbing problem?",
            answer: "F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 2."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the time complexity of solving the matrix chain multiplication problem using dynamic programming?",
            answer: "The time complexity is O(nÂ³), where n is the number of matrices."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the primary advantage of using dynamic programming over naive recursive solutions?",
            answer: "Dynamic programming reduces time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations, making it efficient for problems with overlapping subproblems."
        },
        {
            question: "How does dynamic programming optimize the assembly line scheduling problem?",
            answer: "Dynamic programming computes the minimum time to complete each station step-by-step, storing results to avoid redundant calculations."
