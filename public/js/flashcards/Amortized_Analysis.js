            question: "What is amortized analysis?",
            answer: "Amortized analysis measures the average time complexity of an operation over a sequence of operations, providing a more accurate assessment than worst-case analysis."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the key difference between average case and amortized analysis?",
            answer: "Average case considers all possible inputs, while amortized analysis assumes a sequence of operations and provides the average cost per operation."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the three methods of amortized analysis?",
            answer: "1. Aggregate method\n2. Accounting method\n3. Potential method"
        },
        {
            question: "What is the aggregate method in amortized analysis?",
            answer: "The aggregate method calculates the total cost of a sequence of operations and divides it by the number of operations."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the accounting method in amortized analysis?",
            answer: "The accounting method assigns an amortized cost to each operation, ensuring the total amortized cost covers the actual cost."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the potential method in amortized analysis?",
            answer: "The potential method uses a potential function to represent the 'stored work,' adjusting it to account for expensive operations."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the amortized time complexity of push and multipop operations on a stack?",
            answer: "The amortized time complexity is O(1) for push and multipop operations combined over a sequence."
        },
        {
            question: "Why is the potential function important in amortized analysis?",
            answer: "It allows tracking of stored work or resources, making it easier to analyze the cost of sequences of operations."
        },
        {
            question: "How does amortized analysis apply to dynamic array resizing?",
            answer: "Doubling the size of an array during resizing incurs O(n) cost, but over many operations, the amortized cost remains O(1)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the main advantage of using amortized analysis?",
            answer: "It provides a realistic measure of performance over sequences of operations, smoothing out expensive operations."
