            question: "What is the cardinality of a set?",
            answer: "The cardinality of a set is the number of elements it contains."

            question: "What is the empty set?",
            answer: "The empty set, denoted as {}, contains no elements and has a cardinality of 0."

            question: "What is the power set of a set A?",
            answer: "The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all subsets of A."

        {
            question: "What is the union of two sets A and B?",
            answer: "The union, denoted A âˆª B, is the set of elements that are in A, B, or both."

            question: "What is the intersection of two sets A and B?",
            answer: "The intersection, denoted A âˆ© B, is the set of elements that are in both A and B."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the complement of a set A?",
            answer: "The complement of A is the set of elements not in A but within a universal set U."

            question: "State De Morgan's Laws for sets.",

            question: "What is the Cartesian product of sets X and Y?",
            answer: "The Cartesian product, denoted X Ã— Y, is the set of ordered pairs (x, y) where x âˆˆ X and y âˆˆ Y."
        },
        {
            question: "How is the equality of two sets A and B proven?",
            answer: "A and B are equal if every element of A is in B and every element of B is in A."

            question: "What is Russell's Paradox?",
            answer: "Russell's Paradox arises when considering the set of all sets that do not contain themselves."
