            question: "What is the definition of a discrete uniform distribution?",
            answer: "A distribution where all outcomes are equally likely, with \( P(X=x) = \\frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the number of outcomes."
        },
        {
            question: "What are the mean and variance of a discrete uniform distribution?",
            answer: "Mean: \( \\mu = \\frac{a+b}{2} \\), Variance: \( \\sigma^2 = \\frac{(b-a+1)^2 - 1}{12} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the range bounds."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a Bernoulli process?",
            answer: "A process with repeated trials, where each trial has two outcomes: success with probability \( p \) and failure with probability \( 1-p \)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the formula for the probability mass function of a binomial distribution?",
            answer: "PMF: \( P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \), where \( k \) is the number of successes in \( n \) trials."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the relationship between the hypergeometric and binomial distributions?",
            answer: "The binomial distribution approximates the hypergeometric distribution when the sample size is small relative to the population size."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the Poisson distribution used for?",
            answer: "It models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given that events occur independently at a constant rate."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the mean and variance of the Poisson distribution?",
            answer: "Both the mean and variance are equal to \( \\lambda t \), where \( \\lambda \) is the rate of occurrence."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the PMF of the geometric distribution?",
            answer: "PMF: \( P(X=x) = (1-p)^{x-1}p \), where \( x \) is the trial on which the first success occurs."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the expected value and variance of a negative binomial distribution?",
            answer: "Mean: \( \\frac{r}{p} \), Variance: \( \\frac{r(1-p)}{p^2} \), where \( r \) is the number of successes and \( p \) is the probability of success."
        },
        {
            question: "When can the Poisson distribution approximate the binomial distribution?",
            answer: "When \( n \) is large and \( p \) is small, with \( \\lambda = np \) remaining constant."
