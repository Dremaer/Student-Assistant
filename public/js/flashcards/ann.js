        { question: "What is the key issue with overfitting in a decision tree?", answer: "The tree is too complex and fits noise in the training data" },
        { question: "What is a 'cost matrix' used for in classification?", answer: "To assign costs to different misclassifications" },
        { question: "Which property makes k-NN a lazy learner?", answer: "It stores all training data and defers computation until prediction" },

        { question: "What does Occamâ€™s Razor imply in model selection?", answer: "Prefer simpler models if they have similar accuracy" },
        { question: "What is the main disadvantage of k-NN when the dataset size increases?", answer: "Distance computation becomes slow" },
