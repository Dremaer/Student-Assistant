        {
            question: "What is the NP class in computational complexity?",
            answer: "NP is the class of problems where a given solution can be verified in polynomial time."
        },
        {
            question: "What does it mean for a problem to be NP-Complete?",
            answer: "A problem is NP-Complete if it is in NP and every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the significance of the P vs NP question?",
            answer: "It asks whether every problem in NP can also be solved in polynomial time, i.e., if P = NP."
        },
        {
            question: "What is an example of an NP-Complete problem?",
            answer: "The SAT (Satisfiability) problem is a classic example of an NP-Complete problem."
        },
        {
            question: "What is polynomial-time reduction?",
            answer: "It is a transformation of one problem into another in polynomial time to show that solving the second problem also solves the first."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)?",
            answer: "It asks for the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city."
        },
        {
            question: "How does the Hamiltonian Cycle problem relate to TSP?",
            answer: "The Hamiltonian Cycle problem is finding a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. It is related to TSP but does not consider edge weights."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the purpose of approximation algorithms for NP-Complete problems?",
            answer: "They provide near-optimal solutions within a provable bound when exact solutions are computationally infeasible."
        },
        {
            question: "Why are NP-Complete problems significant in real-world applications?",
            answer: "Many practical problems, such as scheduling, routing, and optimization, are NP-Complete and lack efficient algorithms."
