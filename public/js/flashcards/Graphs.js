            question: "What is a graph in discrete mathematics?",
            answer: "A graph is defined as G=(V,E), where V is a set of vertices (nodes), and E is a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices."
        },
        {
            question: "What differentiates a directed graph from an undirected graph?",
            answer: "In a directed graph, edges have a direction, whereas in an undirected graph, edges do not have a direction."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a complete graph?",
            answer: "A complete graph is a graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge."
        },
        {
            question: "Define a bipartite graph.",
            answer: "A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertex set can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices in the same set are adjacent."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a spanning tree of a graph?",
            answer: "A spanning tree is a subgraph that includes all vertices of the original graph and is a tree (connected and acyclic)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the handshaking lemma in graphs?",
            answer: "The handshaking lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph equals twice the number of edges."
        },
        {
            question: "What is an Eulerian circuit?",
            answer: "An Eulerian circuit is a circuit that uses every edge of a graph exactly once and starts and ends at the same vertex."
        },
        {
            question: "What conditions must be met for a graph to be Eulerian?",
            answer: "A connected graph is Eulerian if and only if every vertex has an even degree."
        },
        {
            question: "Define a Hamiltonian cycle.",
            answer: "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits every vertex of the graph exactly once."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference between depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS)?",
            answer: "DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, while BFS explores all neighbors of a vertex before moving to the next level."
