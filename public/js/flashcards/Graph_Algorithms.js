            question: "What is a graph G = (V, E)?",
            answer: "A structure where V is a set of nodes and E is a set of edges connecting those nodes."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference between a directed graph and an undirected graph?",
            answer: "In a directed graph, edges have direction, while in an undirected graph, they do not."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a weighted graph?",
            answer: "A graph where each edge is assigned a numerical value called a weight."
        },
        {
            question: "How is connectivity defined in a graph?",
            answer: "Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them. A graph is connected if all pairs of nodes are connected."
        },
        {
            question: "What is Depth First Search (DFS) used for?",
            answer: "DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, used for graph traversal."
        },
        {
            question: "What is Breadth First Search (BFS) used for?",
            answer: "BFS explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level, used for shortest path in unweighted graphs."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?",
            answer: "An MST is a subgraph connecting all nodes with the minimum possible total edge weight."
        },
        {
            question: "What algorithms are used to find an MST?",
            answer: "Primâ€™s algorithm and Kruskalâ€™s algorithm."
        },
        {
            question: "What is Dijkstra's algorithm used for?",
            answer: "Finding the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the Bellman-Ford algorithm used for?",
            answer: "Finding shortest paths in graphs with edges that may have negative weights."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the key idea behind Floyd-Warshall algorithm?",
            answer: "It calculates shortest paths between all pairs of nodes by considering intermediate nodes one by one."
