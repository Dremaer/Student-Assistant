            question: "What does Theorem 7.1 describe for transformations of discrete random variables?",
            answer: "It states that if \( Y = u(X) \) is a one-to-one transformation, the probability distribution of \( Y \) is \( g(y) = f(w(y)) \), where \( x = w(y) \)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is Theorem 7.3 for continuous random variables?",
            answer: "For \( Y = u(X) \), the probability distribution is \( g(y) = f(w(y)) |J| \), where \( J \) is the Jacobian of the transformation."
        },
        {
            question: "How do you find the distribution of \( Y = 2X - 1 \) for a discrete random variable \( X \)?",
            answer: "Use the probability of transformed values \( y = 2x - 1 \) and map them back to their corresponding probabilities in \( X \)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the Jacobian in Theorem 7.3?",
            answer: "The Jacobian \( J \) is the derivative \( w'(y) \) used in transformations of continuous random variables."
        },
        {
            question: "What does Theorem 7.4 describe for joint transformations?",
            answer: "It gives the joint probability distribution of two transformed variables \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \) using their original joint distribution and the determinant of the Jacobian matrix."
        },
        {
            question: "How can you transform a random variable to find its new distribution?",
            answer: "Identify the relationship \( Y = u(X) \), solve for \( X \) as \( w(Y) \), and apply the corresponding formula for discrete or continuous variables."
        },
        {
            question: "What is an example of using Theorem 7.5 for a non-one-to-one transformation?",
            answer: "If \( X \) can map to multiple values of \( Y \), the probability distribution of \( Y \) sums the contributions from all inverse mappings."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the importance of Theorem 7.2 in joint transformations for discrete variables?",
            answer: "It calculates the joint probability distribution of transformed variables \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \) based on the joint distribution of \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a real-world application of random variable transformations?",
            answer: "Transformations are used in statistics for rescaling data, modeling, and finding derived distributions, such as time to failure or population changes."
        },
        {
            question: "How is independence preserved in transformations?",
            answer: "For independent random variables \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \), independence is preserved if their transformations do not introduce dependencies."
