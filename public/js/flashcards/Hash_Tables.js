            question: "What is a hash table?",
            answer: "A hash table is a data structure where elements are stored at positions determined by a hash function for efficient access, insertion, and deletion."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the average time complexity for searching, inserting, and deleting in a hash table?",
            answer: "The average time complexity is O(1) for all these operations."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a hash function?",
            answer: "A hash function maps keys to indices in a hash table, typically of the form \( h(x) = (ax + b) \mod p \), where \( p \) is a prime number."
        },
        {
            question: "What is a collision in a hash table?",
            answer: "A collision occurs when two keys are mapped to the same index in the hash table."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the difference between chaining and open addressing in resolving collisions?",
            answer: "Chaining stores all elements that hash to the same index in a linked list, while open addressing finds alternative positions using methods like linear or quadratic probing."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the primary disadvantage of linear probing for collision resolution?",
            answer: "Linear probing can cause clustering, where elements cluster together, reducing efficiency."
        },
        {
            question: "What is double hashing?",
            answer: "Double hashing uses a secondary hash function to resolve collisions by providing a different step size for probing."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the load factor (Î±) in a hash table?",
            answer: "The load factor is the ratio of the number of stored elements (n) to the size of the hash table (m): \( \alpha = n / m \)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the effect of increasing the load factor \( \alpha \)?",
            answer: "As \( \alpha \) increases, the likelihood of collisions and average search time also increases."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the purpose of resizing a hash table?",
            answer: "Resizing, typically doubling the size, reduces the load factor and improves efficiency by redistributing the elements."
